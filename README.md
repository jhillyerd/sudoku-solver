sudoku-solver
=============

This is a Golang Sudoku puzzle solver, implemented using a recursive
backtracking algorithm.  It was created to learn more about recursive
backtracking, use at your own risk.

Puzzle format:  Each line represents a row of the puzzle, and non-numeric
characters are ignored while parsing each line.  `0` represents an empty
cell.

See `easy.txt`, `hard.txt`, and `ultra.txt` for example puzzles.
